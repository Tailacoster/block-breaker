  storyText: 'A loud screeching alarm sounds throughout the dimly lit room. You''re
    cold, and what little you can see is lit up by red flashing lights. You step
    out of what looks like a human-sized pod that is radiating off vapor like dry
    ice. You gather your thoughts and conclude that you have no idea where you are.


    What
